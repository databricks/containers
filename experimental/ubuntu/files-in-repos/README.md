# Files in Repos Container

This image shows how to enable the Files in Repos FUSE mount that mounts to the local filesystem at `/Workspace`.

For DBR 11 LTS and above, the Files in Repos FUSE mount will always be created, so this custom image will no longer be needed and the standard DCS image may be used instead.
